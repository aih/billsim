Uterine fibroids may cause significant morbidity through their presence in the uterus and pelvic cavity, and symptoms can include pelvic pain, several menstrual bleeding, iron-deficiency anemia, fatigue, bladder or bowel dysfunction, infertility, and pregnancy complications and loss. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6EACA5809B874B34889E523BCB8D7F6D"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The pain, discomfort, stress, and other physical and emotional symptoms of living with fibroids may significantly interfere with a woman’s quality of life, compromising her ability to function normally or work or care for her family, and may lead to more severe health and wellness issues.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE33B99DBBC0640B1BF52BA40E26B1F15"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Most women will experience uterine fibroids by the age of 50, yet few data exist describing the overall patient experience with fibroids. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD2F0F3C067C241F7AABCEC63BE65F359"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Many people with fibroids are likely undiagnosed. Patients wait on average 3.6 years before seeking treatment, and over 40 percent of patients see two or more health care providers prior to receiving a diagnosis, underscoring the need for improved awareness and education.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H74B69D9911A94979A6D4A566D5EF2235"><enum>(6)</enum><text>People of color are more likely to develop uterine fibroids. It is estimated that more than 80 percent of Black women and about 70 percent of white women develop fibroids by the time they reach menopause. Black individuals with fibroids have also been shown to have more severe symptoms and develop early-onset uterine fibroids that develop into larger tumors.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2629012261404C0880D2CEDD10E7AE83"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Current research and available data do not provide adequate information on the prevalence and incidence of fibroids in Asian, Hispanic, and Black individuals.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H22BB88926FE1481694A4695F4DB72A51"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Symptomatic uterine fibroids can cause reproductive problems, including infertility.

There is a great need for minimally invasive, fertility-friendly therapies, as well as biomarkers, imaging assessments, or risk-based algorithms that can help predict patient response to therapy.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H88E4A8FE9BF84D23A85ACEF694FC559E"><enum>(11)</enum><text>The presence of symptomatic uterine fibroids is the most common reason for hysterectomies, accounting for 39 percent of hysterectomies annually in the United States. Approximately 42 per 1,000 women are hospitalized annually because of uterine fibroids, but Black patients have higher rates of hospitalization, hysterectomies, and myomectomies compared to white women. Uterine fibroids are also the leading cause of hospitalization related to a gynecological disorder.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H354A5B3631E2405592811391E1892AB0"><enum>(12)</enum><text>The personal and societal costs of uterine fibroids in the United States are significant. Uterine fibroid tumors have been estimated to cost the United States $5,900,000,000 to $34,400,000,000 annually. The annual direct costs, including surgery, hospital admissions, outpatient visits, and medications, were estimated at $4,100,000,000 to $9,400,000,000 annually. Estimated lost work-hour costs ranged from $1,550,000,000 to $17,200,000,000 annually. Obstetric outcomes that were attributed to fibroid tumors resulted in costs of $238,000,000 to $7,760,000,000 annually.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H7F9C963EB504443F8FAF2690807D3195"><enum>(13)</enum><text>At the federal level, uterine fibroid research remains drastically underfunded as compared to patient disease burden.
