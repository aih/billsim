                                 A BILL


 
To provide for research and education with respect to uterine fibroids, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stephanie Tubbs Jones Uterine 
Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) It is estimated that 20 percent to 50 percent of women 
        of reproductive age currently have uterine fibroids, and up to 
        77 percent of women will develop fibroids before menopause.
            (2) In the United States, an estimated 26,000,000 women 
        between the ages of 15 and 50 have uterine fibroids, and 
        approximately 15,000,000 of these individuals experience 
        symptoms. Uterine fibroids may cause significant morbidity 
        through their presence in the uterus and pelvic cavity, and 
        symptoms can include pelvic pain, several menstrual bleeding, 
        iron-deficiency anemia, fatigue, bladder or bowel dysfunction, 
        infertility, and pregnancy complications and loss.
            (3) The pain, discomfort, stress, and other physical and 
        emotional symptoms of living with fibroids may significantly 
        interfere with a woman's quality of life, compromising her 
        ability to function normally or work or care for her family, 
        and may lead to more severe health and wellness issues.
            (4) Most women will experience uterine fibroids by the age 
        of 50, yet few data exist describing the overall patient 
        experience with fibroids.
            (5) Many people with fibroids are likely undiagnosed. 
        Patients wait on average 3.6 years before seeking treatment, 
        and over 40 percent of patients see two or more health care 
        providers prior to receiving a diagnosis, underscoring the need 
        for improved awareness and education.
            (6) People of color are more likely to develop uterine 
        fibroids. It is estimated that more than 80 percent of Black 
        women and about 70 percent of white women develop fibroids by 
        the time they reach menopause. Black individuals with fibroids 
        have also been shown to have more severe symptoms and develop 
        early-onset uterine fibroids that develop into larger tumors.
            (7) Current research and available data do not provide 
        adequate information on the prevalence and incidence of 
        fibroids in Asian, Hispanic, and Black individuals.
            (8) Symptomatic uterine fibroids can cause reproductive 
        problems, including infertility. People with uterine fibroids 
        are much more likely to miscarry during early pregnancy than 
        people without them.
            (9) According to the Evidence Report Summary on the 
        Management of Uterine Fibroids, as compiled by the Agency for 
        Healthcare Research and Quality of the Department of Health and 
        Human Services, there is a ``remarkable lack of high-quality 
        evidence supporting the effectiveness of most interventions for 
        symptomatic fibroids''.
            (10) Most medical options for managing fibroid symptoms 
        regulate or suppress menstruation and prevent pregnancy. There 
        is a great need for minimally invasive, fertility-friendly 
        therapies, as well as biomarkers, imaging assessments, or risk-
        based algorithms that can help predict patient response to 
        therapy.
            (11) The presence of symptomatic uterine fibroids is the 
        most common reason for hysterectomies, accounting for 39 
        percent of hysterectomies annually in the United States. 
        Approximately 42 per 1,000 women are hospitalized annually 
        because of uterine fibroids, but Black patients have higher 
        rates of hospitalization, hysterectomies, and myomectomies 
        compared to white women. Uterine fibroids are also the leading 
        cause of hospitalization related to a gynecological disorder.
            (12) The personal and societal costs of uterine fibroids in 
        the United States are significant. Uterine fibroid tumors have 
        been estimated to cost the United States $5,900,000,000 to 
        $34,400,000,000 annually. The annual direct costs, including 
        surgery, hospital admissions, outpatient visits, and 
        medications, were estimated at $4,100,000,000 to $9,400,000,000 
        annually. Estimated lost work-hour costs ranged from 
        $1,550,000,000 to $17,200,000,000 annually. Obstetric outcomes 
        that were attributed to fibroid tumors resulted in costs of 
        $238,000,000 to $7,760,000,000 annually.
            (13) At the federal level, uterine fibroid research remains 
        drastically underfunded as compared to patient disease burden. 
        In 2019, fibroid research received about $17,000,000 in funding 
        from the National Institutes of Health, putting it in the 
        bottom 50 of 292 funded conditions.
