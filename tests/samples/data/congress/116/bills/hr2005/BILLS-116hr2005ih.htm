                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to provide 
 for greater spousal protection under defined contribution plans, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Retirement Protection Act of 
2019''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Approximately 29 percent of households headed by 
        individuals aged 55 through 74 have no defined benefit plan or 
        retirement savings, according to 2016 data from the Survey of 
        Consumer Finances.
            (2) Just over one-third of the private sector workforce 
        does not have access to a retirement plan at the workplace, and 
        only half of the workforce actually participates in a 
        retirement plan.
            (3) Women's retirement preparedness often lags 
        significantly behind their male counterparts', resulting in the 
        median retirement income for women in 2016 being just 58 
        percent of men's retirement income.
            (4) Women are 1.5 times as likely as men to live in poverty 
        after age 65.
            (5) Women make up \2/3\ of low-wage workers, even though 
        they comprise less than half of all workers, and low-wage 
        workers are less likely than other workers to participate in a 
        retirement plan at work.
            (6) Because of the pay gap, women working full-time, year-
        round typically lose $403,440 over a 40-year career thereby 
        requiring the average woman to work almost a decade longer than 
        her male counterpart to make up that career wage gap.
            (7) Due to the lower lifetime wages stemming from unequal 
        pay and caregiving duties, the average Social Security benefit 
        for a woman age 65 or older is $14,044 a year, while men of the 
        same age receive $18,173 a year, on average.
            (8) Just 1 in 5 part-time workers who work a full year are 
        eligible for a retirement plan, and women are almost twice as 
        likely to work part-time as men.
            (9) While traditional defined benefit retirement plans have 
        spousal protections, defined contribution retirement plans, 
        which have become increasingly common, currently provide no 
        similar spousal protections.
            (10) Every year, more than 1,200,000 couples get divorced 
        in the United States. After the family home, retirement savings 
        tends to be the largest asset to be divided in a divorce.
            (11) While fees and expenses associated with retirement 
        plans have been in decline, participants have seen direct 
        charges for processing qualified domestic relations orders 
        increase significantly.

SEC. 3. INCREASING SPOUSAL PROTECTION UNDER DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

    (a) In General.--Part 2 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.) is 
amended by inserting after section 205 the following new section:

``SEC. 205A. ADDITIONAL SPOUSAL CONSENT REQUIREMENTS.

    ``(a) In General.--Each individual account plan to which section 
205 does not apply shall provide that, except as provided in 
subsections (c) and (d), no distribution may be made under the plan 
unless the spousal consent requirements of subsection (e) are met.
    ``(b) Coordination With Section 205.--Nothing in this section shall 
be construed to exempt an individual account plan from the requirements 
of paragraph (1)(C) or (2) of section 205(b) with respect to any 
participant.
    ``(c) Exceptions for Certain Distributions.--Subsection (a) shall 
not apply to--
            ``(1) any distribution that is--
                    ``(A) a minimum required distribution described in 
                section 4974(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
                    ``(B) a result of the use of the participant's 
                accrued benefit as security for a loan, including any 
                distribution required by reason of a failure to comply 
                with the terms of such loan;
                    ``(C) made upon hardship of the participant; or

                without the consent of the participant;

        survivor annuity (as defined in section 205(d)(1)), a qualified 
        optional survivor annuity (as defined in section 205(d)(2)), a 
        qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined in section 
        205(e)), or a series of substantially equal periodic payments 
        (not less frequently than annually) made for the joint lives 
        (or life expectancies) of the participant and the participant's 
        spouse; or
            ``(3) in the case of a participant who does not elect a 
        form of benefit described in paragraph (2) under the plan or 
        who is participating in a plan that does not provide such a 
        form of benefit, any distribution of the participant's entire 
        nonforfeitable accrued benefit if 50 percent of such accrued 
        benefit is transferred to an individual retirement plan (as 
        defined in section 7701(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
        1986) of the spouse of the participant.
A transfer described in paragraph (3) to an individual retirement plan 
shall be treated in the same manner as a transfer under section 
408(d)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    ``(d) Exceptions for Certain Rollover Contributions.--Subsection 
(a) shall not apply to any distribution that is an eligible rollover

Revenue Code of 1986) made in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee 
transfer within the meaning of section 401(a)(31) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986--
            ``(1) to a plan to which this section or section 205 
        applies; or

        section 7701(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) if--
                    ``(A) the beneficiary of such plan is the spouse of

                of 1 or more other beneficiaries; and
                    ``(B) the beneficiary of such plan (whether the 
                spouse or other beneficiary designated under paragraph 
                (1)) may not be changed unless--
                            ``(i) the spousal consent requirements of 
                        subsection (e) are met with respect to any such

                        beneficiary other than the spouse expressly 
                        permits such designation to be changed without 
                        the further consent of the spouse.

        agreement which the Secretary finds to be a collective 
        bargaining agreement between employee representatives and 1 or 
        more employers, if there is evidence that retirement benefits 
        were the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee 
        representatives and such employer or employers.

                apply to any employee as of the first plan year 
                beginning after the plan year in which the employee 
                completes 1 year of service (without regard to 
                paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection).

Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1053(a)) is amended by redesignating 
paragraph (4) as paragraph (5) and by inserting after paragraph (3) the 
following new paragraph:

employee who is eligible to participate in a qualified cash or deferred 
arrangement or a salary reduction agreement under a plan solely by 
reason of section 202(c)(1)(B) has a nonforfeitable right to employer

Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1132) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new subsection:
    ``(n) Requirements Relating to Part-Time Employees.--In the case of 
a plan that fails to permit participation as required by section 
202(c), the Secretary may assess a civil penalty against the plan 
sponsor in an amount equal to $10,000 per year per employee to whom 
such failure relates. The Secretary may, in the Secretary's sole 
discretion, waive or reduce the penalty under this subsection if the 
Secretary determines that the plan sponsor acted reasonably and in good 
faith.''.
