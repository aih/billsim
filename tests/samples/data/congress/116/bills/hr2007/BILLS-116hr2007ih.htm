To require the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program for the 
  automated disclosure of taxpayer information for third-party income 
                 verification, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. DISCLOSURE OF TAXPAYER INFORMATION FOR THIRD-PARTY INCOME 
              VERIFICATION.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the close of the 2-
year period described in subsection (d)(1), the Secretary of the 
Treasury or the Secretary's delegate (hereafter referred to in this 
section as the ``Secretary'') shall implement a program to ensure that 
any qualified disclosure--
            (1) is fully automated and accomplished through the 
        Internet; and
            (2) is accomplished in as close to real-time as is 
        practicable.
    (b) Qualified Disclosure.--For purposes of this section, the term 
``qualified disclosure'' means a disclosure under section 6103(c) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of returns or return information by 
the Secretary to a person seeking to verify the income or 
creditworthiness of a taxpayer who is a borrower in the process of a 
loan application.
    (c) Application of Security Standards.--The Secretary shall ensure 
that the program described in subsection (a) complies with applicable 
security standards and guidelines.
    (d) User Fee.--
            (1) In general.--During the 2-year period beginning on the 
        first day of the 6th calendar month beginning after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall assess and 
        collect a fee for qualified disclosures (in addition to any 
        other fee assessed and collected for such disclosures) at such 
        rates as the Secretary determines are sufficient to cover the 
        costs related to implementing the program described in 
        subsection (a), including the costs of any necessary 
        infrastructure or technology.
            (2) Deposit of collections.--Amounts received from fees 
        assessed and collected under paragraph (1) shall be deposited 
        in, and credited to, an account solely for the purpose of 
        carrying out the activities described in subsection (a). Such 
        amounts shall be available to carry out such activities without 
        need of further appropriation and without fiscal year 
        limitation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
